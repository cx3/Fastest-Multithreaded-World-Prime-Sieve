# PrimeNumber MM Sieve
I am proud to announce the fastest prime sieve in the Planet Earth. New enhanced multithreaded version. Works well with C++17. Compiled and tested under Linux Mint 20.2 with G++. On four cores in less than four seconds all primes in range <2; 10^9> is completely a feat beyond my mind - in spite of fact I am co-author of it ..(^^,)..  Polish technological thought!
